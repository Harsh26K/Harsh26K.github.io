                <h1>Stroke Patients Analysis
                    And Classification</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="project-desc">
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p> The project includes analysis of stroke patients
                        dataset and creating classification models for
                        categorizing patients into stroke patients and
                        no-stroke patients.</p>
                    <p> The project is divided into three stages EDA,
                        Visualization and Modeling ,while in last part I share
                        my thoughts. The data for the project was taken from
                        Kaagle.</p>

                    <h4><strong>1. EDA</strong></h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In this stage, data was analysed to see if there
                            are any null values, data inconsistencies etc. and
                            get rid of it.</li>
                        <li>Only 'BMI' column contained null values which were
                            replaced with mean BMI to maintain the
                            distribution.</li>
                        <li>Column 'gender' had only one value Other, which was
                            replaced with Male value based on values of other
                            features.</li>
                        <li>Also, distribution of data and some basic
                            relationships were visualized to understand the
                            data better.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4><strong>2. Visualization</strong></h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The new data created from the visualization was
                            used to create a responsive dashboard to compare or
                            analyse patients with respect to lifestyle health
                            features provided in data.</li>
                        <li>Some numerical variables were converted in
                            categorical groups for better categorising.</li>
                        <li>Some new measures were created using DAX to help
                            with visualization and understanding of patients
                            stats better.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4><strong>3. Modeling</strong></h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The data was preprocessed in the stage with
                            handling categorical variables, Scaling the data
                            etc.</li>
                        <li> The target variable 'stroke' contained heavy
                            imbalance between the categories. The imbalanced
                            was removed using SMOTE.</li>
                        <li>6 classification models using Decision Tree, KNN,
                            Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, XGBoost
                            were created.</li>
                        <li>The performance was analysed for individual
                            classifier and the best model was selected using
                            hyperparameter tuning.</li>
                        <li>The best model of each classifier was trained and
                            tested on the data and metrics scores were recorded
                            and stored for final comparison and conclusion.
                        </li>
                        <li>The model should be selected based on domain
                            knowledge as the evaluation criteria might change.
                        </li>
                    </ol>


                    <h4><strong>4. Conclusion</strong></h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The original data was heavily imbalanced, which
                            affected the result significantly. Using SMOTE
                            improved results slightly which os still good.</li>
                        <li>Regarding Evaluation criteria, In healthcare
                            domain, recall is as important as accuracy, because
                            we want more patients to get treated while avoiding
                            unnecessary treatment for healthy people.
                        </li>
                        <li>The situation demands balanced evaluation between
                            accuracy and recall, which makes 'f1-score with
                            recall score' most valuable metric.</li>
                        <li>Based on above metric, I recommend Logistic
                            Regression. Even though it lacks a little in terms
                            Accuracy. The recall score, f1 score and ROC-AUC
                            score makes it suitable candidate for me. But, it
                            just my opinion.
                        </li>
                        <li> As I mentioned earlier, domain experts can have
                            different opinion depending how they want to handle
                            the problem.</li>
                    </ol>
