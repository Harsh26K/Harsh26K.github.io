                        The project is about predicting Sales of different
                        products from different Big Mart Outlets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project was divided into two parts understanding
                        the dataset [EDA] and analysing performance of
                        different Regression models on the data.
                    </p>

                    <h4><strong>1. EDA</strong></h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            This stage involved understanding the data and
                            getting rid of the unwanted things.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Columns 'Item_weight' and 'Outlet_Type' had missing
                            values. For Column 'Item_weight' the missing values
                            were replaced with weight of same products from
                            different outlets if it was available. For column
                            'Outlet_Type' the null values were replaced with
                            mode of data. The null values still remained were
                            dropped.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The data was inconsistent in column
                            'Item_Fat_Content' i.e. same values were present in
                            different format which were replace with one
                            consistent value
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The data in columns 'Item_Visisbility' and
                            'Item_Outlet_Sales' were skewed which were
                            converted to normal distribution using
                            log-transformation and cuberoot-transformation
                            resp.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Columns 'Item_Visibility' and 'Item_Outlet_Sales'
                            had outliers which were handled using IQR method.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The data was visualised using different graphs
                            using matplotlib and seaborn.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4><strong>2. Model Building</strong></h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            For first step, the unwanted columns like index and
                            identifiers were dropped.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The categorical columns were encoded using pandas
                            get_dummies and Label Encoder.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The numerical columns were scaled down using
                            StandardScaler as Regression models are sensitive
                            to range of data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Different regression models like Linear Regression,
                            Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression
                            and XGBoost Regression etc. were evaluated with
                            cross_validation and hyperparameters against the
                            data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            R2_score and Mean_Absolute_Error was used for
                            individual evaluation while R2_score and
                            Root_Mean_Squared_Error were metrics for final
                            evaluation.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4><strong>3. Conclusion</strong></h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Based on evaluation, SVM seems to performed well
                            while XGBoost can also be a choice as it is close
                            to SVM. Overall performance of models is above
                            average but not good.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            With more in-depth modelling like feature
                            selection, more hyperparameter tuning, improved
                            performance can be achieved.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
