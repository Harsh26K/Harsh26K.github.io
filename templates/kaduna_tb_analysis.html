                    <p> This project was part of colab between Omdena and
                        Kaduna Local Authorities. About 15-20 people were
                        working on the project at different stages of Data
                        Collection, EDA, Visualization, Modeling, Deployment
                        And Presentation. Here is the final result of approx. 3
                        months of hardwork and teamwork.</p>
                    <div>

                            href="https://dagshub.com/Omdena/KadunaNigeriaChapter_Tuberculosis"><strong>Dagshub
                                Repo</strong></a>
                        <p></p>
                        <a href="https://kadunastatetbanalysis.streamlit.app/"><strong>Dashboard
                                App</strong></a>
                    </div>
                    <p> I was mainly part of EDA and Visualization team
                        although I wanted to be involved in all phases. The
                        data collected was divided into blocks where I worked
                        on Block2C. The contents of the blocks were slightly
                        different from each other, so is the focus of Analysis.
                    </p>

                    <h4><strong>1. EDA</strong></h4>
                    <p> For starting phase, The data was separated in years[for
                        each block],So separate analysis for each year
                        2021,2022,first_half-2023 and then combined analysis
                        for whole period was done.</p>
                    <p> At later stages, the new data was added from 2019,2020
                        and second_half-2023. The EDA for combined period of
                        2019-2023 was performed. </p>
                    <p> This phase involved analysing inconsistencies like null
                        values, outliers,data_types and data_values etc. as
                        well as analysing distributions of the data. Using
                        Python and Plotly the task was completed very
                        effectively.</p>

                    <p>Because of the amazing work of the data preprocessing
                        team and simplicity of data there were no major
                        challenges.
                        But few minor as challenges mentioned below - </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Few Null values were present which were imputed
                            with zero.</li>
                        <li>The names of LGAs were slightly different from
                            references which were corrected.</li>
                        <li>The data format for columns "LGA" and "Age_Gr" for
                            2021 were different from that of 2022 and 2023, so
                            for combined EDA changes data was replaced in 2021
                            to maintain consistency.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>Here are some of the findings from the
                        Block2C_EDA_updated.</h5>
                    <li> The dataset was balanced w.r.t. all features</li>
                    <li> The dataset contained 14 original and 1
                        engineered(Year_Quarter)</li>
                    <li>The data was from 2019-2023</li>
                    <li>Column 'Total'[later 'TB_Cases'] had some mislleneous
                        values.</li>
                    <li>'TB_Cases' column was right skewed with most of the
                        values less than 10.</li>

                    <h4><strong>2. Visualization</strong></h4>
                    Plotly was used during this phase to showcase trends and
                    insights related to TB Cases w.r.t different demographics.

                    <h4><strong>3. Modeling</strong></h4>
                    Although could not be part of modeling team, I tried to
                    create clustring based model for the data using K-means,
                    DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixtures algoritms.
                    The data was scaled using both StandardScaler and
                    MinMaxScaler.

                    Elbow Method was used for finding Optimal K in KMeans.
                    K-distance Graph was used for finding Optimal eps values in
                    DBSCAN.
                    AIC and BIC score were used for finding n_components in
                    Gaussian Mixtures.

                    Total 8 clusters were formed based on evaluations.

                    The Silhouette Score was used as a metric for performance
                    evaluations.

                    Silhouette score for final models were:
                    <ol>
                        <li>KMeans: <strong>0.4121</strong></li>
                        <li>DBSCAN: <strong>0.4121</strong></li>
                        <li>GMM: <strong>0.4377</strong></li>
                    </ol>
